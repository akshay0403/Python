-> Intorduction
	- Displaying information in the form of plots and graphs is known as Data Visualization
	
	- It helps to analyze and visualize data clearly and make concrete decisions
	
	- The goal of data visualization is to communicate information in a clear and efficient manner
	
-> Import Matplotlib
	- To start working with Matplotlib, we need to import it
		o import matplotlib
		
	- Most of the time we will be working with pyplot interface of matplotlib, so we need to import that too
		o import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
	- Inorder to display the plot correctly we use
		o %matplotlib inline
	
-> Visualization with Pyplot
	- It plots the graph according to x-axis and y-axis
	- If the y-axis plots are given but x-axis is not, it automatically generates the x-axis plots
	
-> Parts of a Plot
	- There are different parts for a ploy
	- Like line, Title, Grid, Markers etc..
	
-> Line Plot
	- Simple line plot
	- We can use this for any functions like, trignometry etc.
	
-> Scatter Plot
	- The points are represented indicidually with dots or circles
	
-> Histogram
	- They are a graphical display of frequencies
	- They are represented as bars
	
-> Bar Chart
	- Display rectangular bars either in vertical or horizontal form
	- The length of the bar is equal to the value
	
-> Error Bar
	- Represents the overall distribution of data
	
-> Stacked Bar Chart
	- We can draw this by using a special function called bottom
	
-> Pie Chart
	- These are circular representations, divided into sectors
	- The arc length of each sector represents the value

-> Box Plot
	- We can compare distributions of values by showing median, quartiles, min, max of the set of values
	
-> Area Chart
	- This is similar to Line Plot
	- The area between the x-axis and the line is filled with colour
	
-> Contour Plot
	- They are usefull to display three-dimensional data in two-dimensional using contour or colours

-> Adding a Grig
	- We can get more information, if there is a reference system in the plot
	- Reference system would improve the comprehension of the plot

-> Handling Axes
	- Matplotlib automatically sets the limits of the plot to contain the plotted datasets
	- We can set our own limits to the axes
	
-> Handling X and Y Ticks
	- It returns the current ticks location and the lables corresponding to each of them
	
-> Adding Labels
	- They specify the type of data we are plotting
	
-> Adding a Title
	- The title of the plot describes about the plot
	
-> Adding a Legend
	- They are used to describe what each line or curve means in the plot

-> Control Colours
	- This means we can use our own colour for the line or curve
	
-> Control Line Styles
	- This means we can use our own line style for the line or curve
